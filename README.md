**LISTEN FOR VISION **

      Android application for visually impaired people.
 
Our proposed model will assist visually impaired to navigate independently without any human assistance. 
Goal of this project is that , the proposed system should be able to run in real-time on the mobile phone with high accuracy and with minimal size and resource usage.
The mobile application uses an android camera to capture and deliver sequence input images to the deep learning model, which perform object recognition and provide voice comments that help the visually impaired understand the objects and obstacles in the outdoor and indoor environment.
